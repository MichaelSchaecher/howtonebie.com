As a beginner I decided to create a static website to share my knowledge and experience that I have gained while learning general development and programming skills. This website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and is hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). Mostly I did this as way to keep how-to guides for myself, but I hope that it will be useful for others as well.
