What can I say about myself? I'm a newbie as far as blogging goes and most anything else I do. Basically knowing enough to get myself into trouble. I'm a computer enthusiast, a Linux user, and a fan of open-source software that has a day job to pay the bills.

For the past few years, I've used Linux as my primary operating system: Going from Ubuntu and Arch Linux, but mostly sticking with Ubuntu based distributions. Although, there was a three year stint with Windows 10 and 11. Which most of the time was spent trying to make it look and feel like Linux by using [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) linked was [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal). I well say the **Windows Terminal** is a great terminal emulator and something that [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows) should have had years ago.

So what do I do? Well my day job is handling raw plastic materials and making sure they are processed correctly on several different machines throughout the day. As for my hobbies, I'm currently learning how to be a good little home owner which is by far the most challenging thing I've been doing.

Now I feel like a true American with a 200,000 dollar mortgage to pay off over the next 30 years.

What got me into computers in the first place was that I broke my first one a long time ago and had to pay to get it fixed. After that, I decided that I needed to learn how to fix it myself. Sense then I've build my own system a few times. Starting with simple dual-core systems that I later turned into quad-core multi media home theater systems.

I started dabbling in Linux around 2010 when I got my first Android phone and wanted to learn how to root it and later bricked it. In order to fix it, I had to learn how to use Linux or at least an OS that was capable of running the tools needed to fix it. At the time that was **Ubuntu** which at the time could be installed as an app on Windows.

these days I've mostly been using a laptop as my primary system of which I have running [Kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org/).
